The data is tales submitted by writers, in a given month. Column 1 is writer_id (ID of a writer). Column 2 is tale_id, each submission by a writer is a unique tale_id. A writer may have submitted more than 1 tale in the given month.

Givens:

1. Outgrow publishes 10 stories a day.

2. A writer gets Rs 1000 every time his/her story is published (more published => more money => higher happier index)

3. A writer becomes increasingly unhappy if his/her story isn't getting published for many days (less income => unhappy)

4. All tales are of good and equal quality (these are selected tales)

5. The submissions data is made available on the 1st of the month, and the schedule is to be generated based on this tale/writer data.
